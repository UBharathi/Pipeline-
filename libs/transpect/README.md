# Transpect Xproc library

## Modifications of the lib

Be aware that in order to ease the build with maven, the java sources of the unzip-extension, mathtype-extension, xproc-util modules are moved to follow the normal maven project source-tree construction (the trees are moved to the top level src/main/java folder).
