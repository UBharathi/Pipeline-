# ------------
#
# Afrikaans is one of the 11 official languages in South Africa and is
# among the top 3 most widely spoken local languages. It is a language
# closely related to Dutch and uses the same alphabet, but in addition
# it makes frequent use of the following diacritic marks on vowels:
# acute and grave accent, circumflex and umlaut.
#
# The first braille system for Afrikaans was developed in about
# 1935. After the adoption of the UEB in 2004 in Toronto, Canada, we
# also unified the Afrikaans braille code according to the principles
# of the UEB. The grade 1 code is identical to grade 1 UEB. Grade 2
# has 183 contractions. Each letter of the alphabet except the letter
# u (which is a word on its own) represents a contraction in grade
# 2. As with UEB, we eliminated the contractions which could cause
# ambiguity. In one respect Afrikaans braille is simpler than UEB, but
# in another respect it is more complex: It is simpler in that it does
# not have the complexity around shortforms found in UEB grade 2. It
# is more complex because of linguistic reasons. In Afrikaans compound
# words are frequently created on the fly and this can cause
# contraction issues at word boundaries.
#
# We do not use additional codes such as Nemeth or computer braille
# codes; we use our unified Afrikaans code also for technical
# material.
